```php
const Natan = {
  pronouns: ["he", "him"],
  code: [
    "PHP",
    "SQL",
    "Javascript",
    "JQuery",
    "Ajax",
    "HTML",
    "CSS",
    "Python"
  ],
  tools: [
    "Laravel",
    "Symfony",
    "Angular",
    "Vue",
    "Jetstream",
    "Inertia",
    "PWA",
    "Composer",
    "Node"
  ],
  challenge: "Working on PowerBi and Tableau Software Embedded integration."
}
```
