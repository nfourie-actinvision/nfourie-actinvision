### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

```php
const Natan = {
  pronouns: ["he", "him"],
  code: [
    "PHP",
    "SQL",
    "Javascript",
    "JQuery",
    "Ajax",
    "HTML",
    "CSS",
    "Python"
  ],
  tools: [
    "Laravel",
    "Symfony",
    "AngularJS",
    "Vue",
    "PWA",
    "Composer",
    "Node"
  ],
  challenge: "Keeping the SFTP vscode extension fork up-to-date."
}
```

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Please reffer to `challenge` inside the `Natan` const Object.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can fold my right ear in two.
